- 👋 Hi, I’m robertod-adams
- 👀 I'm interested in entering this broad technology market that there are countless areas to work in, which is why I've been dedicating myself to this spectacular front-end area.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning the three tools: front, html, css and javascript, and my goal is to learn the react and angular frameworks, to be a differentiator in my role.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate in the area of ​​technology, which is an excellent way to contribute to innovation and development of new solutions, ideas on how I can improve in this sector, is to contribute to open source projects, which are software that anyone can use, modify and improve .

- ⚡ Fun fact: Curiosity: The domino effect, cascade effect or chain effect suggests the idea of ​​an effect being the cause of another effect generating a series of similar events of medium, long or infinite duration. Interestingly, this effect happened to me, never before an accident that I experienced in 2021, I had an interest in the area of ​​technology, this accident caused an almost total loss of memory, and after that, through friends I started to become interested in programming, and more I specify the front-end, unlike those that are low code, and that's what I'm in the learning process with every day that passes.
